Google Photos has a really nice Dark Mode in the Mobile App, but the Googlers have forgotten the Web App. This is my implementation of a Dark Mode for Desktops.

## Installation

1. Install the browser extension Stylus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/) or Cascadea for [Safari](https://cascadea.app/) to apply this style.
2. Apply it here: [google-photos-dark-mode.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macx/google-photos-dark-mode/main/google-photos-dark-mode.user.css).

## How does this work?

With a so-called user styles, you can override the styles from the origin page within your browser. You are a single click away, to apply the Dark Mode to your Google Photos Web App.
